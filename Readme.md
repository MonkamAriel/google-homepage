Hello
 This is my first Odin project, intended to build the google homepage.
 This was taking into consideration, mainly the structure (physical view) of the page and little importance to the effects.
 Skills such as the use of class and Id
 Positioning is one of the major skills i was able to appreciate 
 background position for image,
 the use of the float and how to apply it properly so the site's structure maintains
 Manipulation of elements using css to arrive at vertical and horizontal blocks
 All these skills are great and of interest to be acquired as they are fundamental in structuring your web page.
 These are the skills i demonstrated to attain my result.
